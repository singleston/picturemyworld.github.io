title: Preparing The Lovo
caption: Remember the Lovo (food cooked within an undergroud oven)? That's how they do it. First build a stack of wood in a hole and put some big rocks on top. Set it on fire and when the wood is gone, add the food on the hot rocks and cover it again with dirt. Pretty smart uh?
