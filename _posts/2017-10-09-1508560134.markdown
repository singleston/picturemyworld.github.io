title: Hobbiton Movie Set
caption: When peter Jackson and his team built the hobbiton movie set again for the Hobbit movies they actually used real materials in order to make it last for years, and thus creating another tourist attraction in New Zealand. Nonetheless it was very interesting to learn how they made the movies and see all those hobbit holes!
