location_text: Playa Cavancha, Iquique, Chile
title: Not Miami either
caption: Iquique was the first big chilean city I reached after Bolivia. It is actually really nice there with the ocean, good weather, a sea-front area made for families with playgrounds and everything. And of course lots of wave and a nice surf spot!
