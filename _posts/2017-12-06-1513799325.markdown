title: Tatau
caption: The word tattoo comes from the samoan word 'Tatau' where the art first started. This man has a full traditional tatau on ihmself from the hips down to the knees (the arm is not part of the cultural tatau). All this was not made with a machine but with a set of needle poked into his skin (or maybe even with a bone instead!).
