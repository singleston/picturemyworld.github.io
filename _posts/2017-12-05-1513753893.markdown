location_text: Namua, Samoa
title: Turtle Island
caption: Namua is famous for the amount of turtles swimming in its bay. Locals do not hunt/fish them but protect them. That kid behind me had just jumped out of the boat, caught the turtle and tried to bring it back on board for few minutes. Very intense moment.
