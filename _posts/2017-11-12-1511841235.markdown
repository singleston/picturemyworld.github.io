title: Lovo
caption: As part of their cultural heritage Fijians build an oven in the ground by puttings rocks on a fire and then burry them with food underground. This is called 'Lovo' and they usually cook meet and Kasava (kind of a potato). Taste nice and is interesting, but nothing like a real oven!
