location_text: Mancora, Peru
title: First day in Peru
caption: I knew the northern part of the country was pretty dry, but I did not imagine such a desertic place. The entire region looks like a western movie. Other than that, the town Mancora is a pretty sweet surf spot and a party town, a bit like Monta√±ita in Ecuador... but less good! =]
