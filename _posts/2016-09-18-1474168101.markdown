title: Famous Stuffed Pizza
caption: This is what the famous stuffed pizza of Chicago looks like. It is basically a normal pizza with tomato sauce, cheese, mushrooms and onions but with 10 times too much ingredient that it looks like a quiche. It is actually very tasty but also very fat. This one was a 'small' one which was actually sufficient for 3 persons!
