title: Phong Nha Cave
caption: This cave is the longest wet cave in Asia. I took a boat ride in there.... and fell asleep! I was rushing through the country, taking overnight buses and trying to see as much as possible within few days. So when it went all quiet, in a warm and dark place, I coudln't resist but take a nap...
