title: Nazca Valley
caption: The Nazca Valley is one of the driest and least windy valleys in the world. So basically, if you draw anything on the floor it might stay there for years or more. The Nazca people used this to create geometrical and animal shapes that are still present nowadays; all this for unknown reasons.
