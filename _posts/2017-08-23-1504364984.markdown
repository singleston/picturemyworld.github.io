title: Colca Canyon
caption: The Colca Canyon is one of the deepest in the world with a depth of 3270 metres. Locals still maintain their pre-Inca traditions and agricultural terraces. I went down to the bottom of that canyon and back up the day after. Definitely a very hard time as there is no shadow in the canyon, it is burning hot down there!!
