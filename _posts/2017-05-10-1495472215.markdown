title: Black river
caption: Pretty hard to see again, but the water is black. Most of the Amazon forest is over a layer of clay that the rain water cannot go through. All that water forms rivers that finally go into the Amazon river. But when flowing through the jungle it carries leaf and other nnatural things that decay and create that black color.
