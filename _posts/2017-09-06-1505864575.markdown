caption: Did I tell you that story where I lost a toe? <br />Oh don't worry it is still there... but numb. Like I don't really feel it anymore. Basically my toes were so cold up there I couldn't sense them anymore. When I took off my climbing boots I had ice on that one toe! Maybe the sweat turned into ice? haha
