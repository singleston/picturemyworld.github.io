title: Fishes and birds
caption: We spent few in days in this fishing village on the Pacific coast. One morning I went to the fish market to buy some schrimps straight from the boats. I had the chance to see some dead sharks of all kinds. I haven't taken any photo, even though it was pretty impressive it still was a sad thing to see.
