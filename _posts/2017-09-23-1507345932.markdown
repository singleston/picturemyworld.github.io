location_text: Parque Japones, La Serena, Chile
title: Parque Japones
caption: La Serena is a very famous destination in summer for chileans. But during winter (or spring) it's all gray and cold. Plus, I had so much work to do that the only time I got out of the hostel was to checkout this Japanese garden. Quite pretty uh?
