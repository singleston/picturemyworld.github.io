caption: At the end of the day we arrived at the top of the mountain where this cute wooden house was waiting for us. Inside, no electricty, no shower, no warm water either, just cold not-so-drinkable rain water. The night was very cold but quite funny as 21 persons slept inside it that night. We basically played Tetris with the matress :D
