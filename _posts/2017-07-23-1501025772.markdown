caption: The archaeological site of Chan Chan belonged to the Chim√∫ people before it fell to the Incas around 1470 AD. This picture has been taken in what was a temple for those people. Before being a temple, it was a King palace, but after his death, the new king had to build a new one for himself and maintain the previous one as a temple.
