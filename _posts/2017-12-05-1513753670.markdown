title: Beach Fale
caption: The one speciality of Samoa are the Fale (which you can see on the right side of the picture). Those wooden construction s are where the locals have a rest in the afternoon, sleep, eat and everything. Their house is based on this but are usually bigger and not this close to the ocean. But the tourists do sleep in there, and I did! Almost every night in Samoa.
