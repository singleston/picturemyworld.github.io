title: Ceiba tree
caption: This giant tree is one of the biggest in the amazon forest. It is the same familly tree than the ones venered by the Mayans. Here the indegenous people believe that the spirit of a good person once he passes away will go to the top of the tree and the bad ones will stay at the bottom. That is also why you will not see a mother with a baby walking pass such tree.
