title: Conflicted City
caption: The city of San Francisco has a huge conflict of social classes. First, there is all those rich people working in the area. Second, the more modest people that struggle to survive in a city where accomodations became very very expensive. And finally a lot of homeless people staying around as the city helps them in different ways. But this conflict also makes the beauty and complexity of San Francisco!
