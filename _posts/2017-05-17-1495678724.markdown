location_text: Laguna Toreadora, Ecuador
title: Small trek, big lake
caption: The highlight of our day at the Cajas National Park was the Toreadora lake. We walked around for maybe 2 hours, took lots of pictures, few selfies, and finally get back pretty tired due to the altitude with more than 3500 meters above sea level! Bonus, an amazing launch with a view and a very good fish in the plate hahaha
