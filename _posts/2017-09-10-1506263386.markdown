caption: In every mine in the Cerro Rico, the 'Lord of the Underworld' is venered by the workers as they offer him cigarettes, coca leaves, and alcohol. On the historical side, the slaves that were forced to work under the Spanish domination created that god as a way to mock and protest again the Catholic Church.
