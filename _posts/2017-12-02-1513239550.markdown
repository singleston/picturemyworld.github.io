location_text: Tiavea, Upolu, Samoa
title: Mission
caption: This is the bay of Tiavea, very famous for its different surf breaks. But we didn't go to the one up front, no too easy, we actually walked (and rock climbed) around the bay to get to the next where a better wave was. The locals call it 'mission' because it is one to get there!
