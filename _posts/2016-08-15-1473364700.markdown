caption: Carcassone is a mediaval citadel built at the top of hill in southern France’s Languedoc region. The "Cité" has two fortification walls in Gallo-Roman style. The inner part is really nice and ancient but, now filled with tourist shops, tourist restaurants and tourist people. Very nice to see, not to stay...
